# OLED_Display-BLE_Communication-LED_Lighting-Mains_Relay_Control-Winter_Cooler_AIO
An all in one for my Arduino UNO(clone), Pro Mini(clone), and MEGA(clone) projects.
Current perpetual next stage:
	DeltaTime. (displaying as 0?)
	PWM 12V computer case fan winter cooler climate control. (temperature problems?)
	Default ON Relay controller. (working)
	PWM breathing 12V LED strip light with microswitch grounded when door is open to enable maximum output and enable previously disabled strips. (PWM problems?)
